THE INTERLOCKING NETWORK OF STALKS AND BRANCHES AND CREEPERS WAS SKELETAL, THE FOSSIL YARD OF AN
EXTINCT SPECIES OF FINEBONED INSECTOID CREATURES. ALL OF THESE BONES, THEN, SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN
STAINED BY SUN AND EARTH FROM AN ORIGINAL LIVING WHITE TO BROWN, AND NOT THE TOUGH FIBROUS FLOWER
AND SEED-SPILLING GREEN THEY ACTUALLY ONCE HAD BEEN. HOWARD WONDERED ABOUT A MAN WHO HAD NEVER SEEN
SUMMER, A WINTER MAN, EXAMINING THE WEEDS AND MAKING THIS INFERENCE -- THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT AN
OSSUARY. THE MAN WOULD TAKE THAT AS TRUE AND BASE HIS IDEAS OF THE WORLD ON THAT MISTAKE.

'AH,' SAID GANDALF, 'NOW WE COME TO IT. I THINK GOLLUM TRIED TO. HE SET OUT AND CAME BACK WESTWARD,
AS FAR AS THE GREAT RIVER. BUT THEN HE TURNED ASIDE. HE WAS NOT DAUNTED BY THE DISTANCE, I AM SURE.
NO, SOMETHING ELSE DREW HIM AWAY. SO MY FRIENDS THINK, THOSE THAT HUNTED HIM FOR ME.

'THE WOOD-ELVES TRACKED HIM FIRST, AN EASY TASK FOR THEM, FOR HIS TRAIL WAS STILL FRESH THEN.
THROUGH MIRKWOOD AND BACK AGAIN IT LED THEM, THOUGH THEY NEVER CAUGHT HIM. THE WOOD WAS FULL OF THE
RUMOUR OF HIM, DREADFUL TALES EVEN AMONG BEASTS AND BIRDS. THE WOODMEN SAID THAT THERE WAS SOME NEW
TERROR ABROAD, A GHOST THAT DRANK BLOOD. IT CLIMBED TREES TO FIND NESTS; IT CREPT INTO HOLES TO FIND
THE YOUNG; IT SLIPPED THROUGH WINDOWS TO FIND CRADLES.

'BUT AT THE WESTERN EDGE OF MIRKWOOD THE TRAIL TURNED AWAY. IT WANDERED OFF SOUTHWARDS AND PASSED
OUT OF THE WOOD-ELVES' KEN, AND WAS LOST. AND THEN I MADE A GREAT MISTAKE. YES, FRODO, AND NOT THE
FIRST; THOUGH I FEAR IT MAY PROVE THE WORST. I LET THE MATTER BE. I LET HIM GO; FOR I HAD MUCH ELSE
TO THINK OF AT THAT TIME, AND I STILL TRUSTED THE LORE OF SARUMAN.

'WELL, THAT WAS YEARS AGO. I HAVE PAID FOR IT SINCE WITH MANY DARK AND DANGEROUS DAYS. THE TRAIL WAS
LONG COLD WHEN I TOOK IT UP AGAIN, AFTER BILBO LEFT HERE. AND MY SEARCH WOULD HAVE BEEN IN VAIN, BUT
FOR THE HELP THAT I HAD FROM A FRIEND: ARAGORN, THE GREATEST TRAVELLER AND HUNTSMAN OF THIS AGE OF
THE WORLD. TOGETHER WE SOUGHT FOR GOLLUM DOWN THE WHOLE LENGTH OF WILDERLAND, WITHOUT HOPE, AND
WITHOUT SUCCESS. BUT AT LAST, WHEN I HAD GIVEN UP THE CHASE AND TURNED TO OTHER PARTS, GOLLUM WAS
FOUND.


# WELCOME TO THE CRYPTOGRAPHY MODULE

BY DECIPHERING THIS PAGE, YOU HAVE SOLVED YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE. CONGRATULATIONS! :)

WE RECOMMEND YOU WRITE A SMALL PROGRAM TO DECIPHER THIS PAGE AUTOMATICALLY AS WE *WILL* BE UPDATING
IT WITH NEW INFORMATION & NEW CHALLENGES OFTEN. THE KEY USED TO ENCRYPT THIS PAGE WILL *NOT* CHANGE,
AND IF IT DOES WE WILL ANNOUNCE IT ON TEAMS.

**NB:** THIS SUBDECT IS **CASE-SENSITIVE** AS WELL AS THE URLS THAT IT CONTAINS. THIS SUBDECT IS
ALSO A CONVENIENT, REGULAR MARKDOWN FILE THAT CONTAINS NEWLINES, SO IF YOUR VERSION DOESN'T WE
SUGGEST YOU CHECK HOW YOU OBTAINED IT FOR YOUR OWN READING CONFORT ;)


# THE PRODECT

THE PRODECT CONSISTS OF A FEW CRYPTOGRAPHY CHALLENGES DETAILED BELOW. SOME CHALLENGES CAN LEAD TO
OTHER, HARDER CHALLENGES, ONCE YOU'VE SOLVED THEM.

IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT IF YOU SCRIPTS OR YOUR TURN-IN SHARE TOO MUCH IN COMMON WITH ANOTHER
GROUP YOU'LL BOTH GET -42. PLEASE DON'T SHARE SOLUTIONS, FIRST OF ALL IT'S NOT FUN, AND SECOND OF
ALL IT SUCKS FOR THEM TOO. THIRD OF ALL, WE ENCOURAGE DENUNCIATION: IF YOU CAN PROVE THAT SOMEONE
SHARED THEIR SOLUTION, WITH YOU OR WITH ANYONE, WE WILL REWARD YOU WITH A HEFTY SUM OF POINTS THAT
AMMOUNTS ROUGHLY TO WHAT A BIG CHALLENGE WOULD YIELD.

THIS MODULE IS MADE WITH LOVE AND WITH THE INTENT OF BEING FUN FOR YOU ALL, SO PLAY BY THE RULES AND
ENDOY <3


# TURN-IN

DURING THE FINAL DEFENSE, YOU WILL BE GRADED ON:

- HOW MANY CHALLENGES YOU'VE SOLVED.
- *HOW* YOU SOLVED THOSE CHALLENGES.
- YOUR ABILITY TO EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING.
- ANY SCRIPTS YOU SUBMIT AS PROOF THAT YOU DID THE TASK (IF IT RE_UIRED SCRIPTING)

YOU SHOULD PRESENT A DETAILED WRITE-UP OF ALL THE EXERCISES YOU DID, STARTING WITH THIS ONE. YOU ARE
FREE TO USE WHICHEVER MEDIUM YOU PREFER: SIMPLE TEXT FILE, A TEAMS CHAT, SOME SLIDES, A PDF, A 
DUPYTER NOTEBOOK... BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD IT TO CHECK IT OUT LATER. YOU'LL ALSO PRESENT
YOUR WRITEUP DURING THE DEFENSE.

THE GOAL OF A WRITE-UP IS TO ALLOW YOU TO UNDERSTAND AGAIN AND REPROCUCE A SOLUTION THAT YOU HAVE
FOUND FOR A CHALLENGE, EVEN IF IT WAS YEARS AGO. AS SUCH, A DUPYTER NOTEBOOK IS PARTICULARLY ADAPTED
FOR PRESENTING CLEAR AND REPRODUCTIBLE WRITE-UPS. THEY OFTEN AWARD EXTRA POINTS DUST BECAUSE THIS
MEDIUM ENCOURAGES YOU TO WRITE BETTER WRITE-UPS.


# EXERCISES

## BASIC

### BASIC1:

YOU ALREADY DID IT! IT'S TO GET TO THIS PAGE!


### BASIC2:

57656C6C20646F6E6520212054686520666C616720666F722074686973206368616C6C656E67652069732074686973206D6573736167652E


### BASIC3:

I ACCIDENTALLY XOR-ENCRYPTED THIS FILE... IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN HELP ME RECOVER IT? IT'S AT:

/CH2.BMP

AND I HAVE A BONUS POINT FOR YOU IF YOU EXPLAIN WHY IT WAS A BAD IDEA TO XOR-ENCRYPT *THIS* FILE...


### BASIC4:

OH NO, I WAS BROWSING THE INTERNET AND I ACCIDENTALLY XOR-ENCRYPTED A VERY IMPORTANT PICTURE, I'M
NOT SURE HOW... I PANICKED AND I CLOSED THE TAB I WAS ON, AND NOW I CAN'T FIND IT AGAIN!

I NEED THE PICTURE, AND I'LL GIVE YOU A BONUS IF YOU CAN FIND THE TAB I WAS ON!

/BASIC4.WEBP


## HASH

### EASY HASHY

OOOPS, I GOT CARRIED AWAY AND HASHED MY SUPER-SECRET PASSWORD. NOW I CAN'T FIND IT AGAIN ! PLEASE,
HELP ME ! HERE'S THE HASH: 37F62F1363B04DF4370753037853FE88


### CONFESSIONS

SEE CONFESSIONS.GEOGRAPHER.FR ;-)


## SYMMETRIC

### SYM1:

OH NO, I DUST LOST THE IV WE USE FOR EVERY ENCRYPTED FILE IN OUR PRODUCTION SYSTEM... ALL I HAVE IS
A SCREENSHOT OF ONE TIME I ENCRYPTED SOME DATA WITH IT, BUT THE SCREENSHOT GOT EDITED BY A L337
HACKER! CAN YOU HELP ME?

THE SCREENSHOT IS HERE: /CH3.DPG


### SYM2: BITE-FLIP

CHALLENGE TO COME!


### SYM3: BITE-FLIP II

CHALLENGE TO COME!


## RSA

### RSA1: WARM UP

LET'S SEE IF YOU GOT MY CLASS. DOWNLOAD /RSA1.PEM, IT'S A PUBLIC KEY.
NOW DOWNLOAD /RSA1CIPHER.TXT
THE MESSAGE WAS ENCRYPTED USING THE "PKCS1 OAEP" ALGORITHM WITH THIS PUBLIC KEY. TRY DECRYPTING IT.
OH YEAH - AND HERE'S A NUMBER THAT COULD BE USEFUL ;)

P = 11901234461494228310064076121482038286429650089208969229876184007349956782094248940290427800597817633601014470221576037327691902428151823981665392121868907


### RSA2: MANYKEYS

FIND THE CHALLENGE YOURSELF.


### RSA3: MULTIPLE RECIPIENTS

THE IT DEPARTMENT SENT A MESSAGE TO A FEW EMPLOYEES, AND WE'VE INTERCEPTED IT. WE SHOULD RETRIEVE
THIS POTENTIALLY VITAL INFORMATION - THIS IT DEPARTMENT USES A HOMEMADE RSA IMPLEMENTATION, THIS IS
OUR CHANCE!
